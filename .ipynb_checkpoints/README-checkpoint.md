## Installation

The installation process should:
 - Prompt the user for a conda environment name
 - Install all necessary packages.
 - Add new environment to the list of available kernels for jupyter.

Run the file "install.sh" by typing the following commands on a terminal:
```bash
#This command allows the file to be executed as a program
chmod +x install.sh

#This command runs the installation file
./install.sh
```

## Opening the tool.
* Open the "Main.ipynb" file (double-clicking is fine)
* On the top right, change the kernel to the one you have just created (Default is IAAT-Env)
* Run each and every cell by clicing Crlt+[Enter] while the cursor is anywhere inside the cell.
